#
# kubeadm join config for High Available (HA) Control Plane and multiple Worker nodes cluster.
#
# 'apiServerEndpoint' should have same config value than in init config for 'controlPlaneEndpoint'
# 'name' must be to unique for every node, 'advertiseAddress' and 'node-ip' must match with 'lima0' interface
# For cluster initial bootstrap convinience 'token' and 'certificateKey' are preconfigured in kubeadm init/join config files and 'unsafeSkipCAVerification' is set.
# This is INSECURE approach but as a bootstrapped cluster is assumed to be shortlived sandbox and running in closed environment this approach was considered acceptable tradeoff.
